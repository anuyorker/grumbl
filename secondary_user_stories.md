## Sentiment Analysis 
Not sure what to do here, I think Anu has a much better grasp on sentiment analysis than I do.

## Locating Food: Filtering Options
As a user, when I query a certain dish, I'd like to be able to specify how I'd like the results to be displayed. 

### By Location
I want to be able to filter dishes based on which is closest to me. In this case, I do not care how great the dish itself is, all I care about is getting my hands on that food. The results in this case will be filtered from closest to furthest available locations depending on where I am when I do the search.

### By Highest Ratings
I want to eat the very best dish that I've searched for. I do not care if it is far away nor do I care if it's expensive. I want my results to show me the highest rated dish and descending into the lowest ranked dish.

### By Price
I am a user on a budget. I want to eat the dish I have searched for, but I would also like to be mindful of the cost. The results from my search will show in descending order most affordable option to most expensive.
