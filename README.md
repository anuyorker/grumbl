## Synopsis 
Grumbl caters to foodies who care more about the food item they want to eat, rather than the restaurant that serves it. It aims to clarify the distinction between “best restaurants” and “best dishes” by providing analysis of specific menu items. The objective is to find the best options of someone’s craving, which does not always correspond to aggregate reviews of restaurants that are often skewed by factors other than general rating. 

This application suggests the best locations available depending on which dish the user inputs. The target market is students in metropolitan college campuses and young urban professionals. The application’s database stores favorites, search queries, and desired dishes for the future. The app utilizes the Google Maps API, Yelp API, and EatStreet API (for restaurant menu information) to provide this service. The app is comprised of saved dishes, food item search, and user profiles (saved items and wishlist). Third-party authentication is required from Facebook.
