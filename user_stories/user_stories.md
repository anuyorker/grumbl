# Primary User Stories

## Sign Up 
As someone who wants to join Grumbl, I want to be able to sign up through the login page by selecting the "New User" option. This link will direct me to a page where I can choose to sign up through Google or Facebook. If I do not have either of those two accounts, I will be directed to the appropriate pages to sign up for either of the two. I can then return to the sign up page of Grumbl to enroll. 

While signing up, I can also input information such as any food preferences. Upon signing up for Grumbl, I will see a page that alerts me that I have successfully joined. I can then navigate to the login page and login with my username and password through whichever service I've chosen (see **Authentication**). 

## Authentication
As a user who is already signed up for Grumbl, I want to be able to login so I can use the service. When I navigate to the login page, I see a prompt to log in with either Facebook or Google. When I enter my username and password, I will be redirected to the home page of Grumbl. If I fail to provide correct authentication information, I will receive an error message and be prompted to try again. 

## Home Page 
As a logged in user, I want to see the Grumbl home page so that I can find the dish I want to eat. The page will show a search bar where users can input a particular dish (i.e. meatloaf, cheeseburger). After pressing search, the page will display different dishes of the food I have searched for. I can then navigate to pages that feature a particular dish and view more information about it such as address and reviews. 

## View Dishes
As a user, I want to be able to see all the information on a certain dish in one place. If I select a specific dish, its corresponding page will show me the restaurant where it is located, a description of the dish, its price, as well as any reviews that have been left previously.

## Review a Dish
As a user, after I have eaten a dish, I want to be able to leave a review so that other users can make decisions on whether or not they want to eat the same dish. If I navigate to the dish's page, I want to see an option to "Leave a Review." When I select this option, I will be navigated to a page where I can write a review with a title and submit it. 

## User Profile
As a user, I want to have a user profile that stores my food preferences and can display my dish lists (see **Lists** in secondary user stories) and dishes I enjoyed previously. When I navigate to my user profile, I will see my username/name as well as my lists, Favorites, and Bookmarks.
